	CPU usage - The script checks the average CPU load percentage and alerts if it exceeds a specified threshold.
	Memory usage - The script calculates the percentage of used memory and alerts if it exceeds a specified threshold.
	Disk usage - The script calculates the percentage of used disk space for each drive and alerts if it exceeds a specified threshold.
	Network latency - The script pings the server and alerts if the response time exceeds a specified threshold.
